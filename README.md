# Planned Planthood 

This project was created as part of a course assignment, with the explicit goal of **going back to basics** in frontend development.

Rather than relying on frameworks or libraries, the focus here is on:
- Writing **clear, semantic HTML**
- Building **responsive layouts with plain CSS**
- Developing a **deeper understanding of CSS structure, variables, and layout techniques**
- Practicing **accessible, well-structured markup**

## Purpose of the Project

After spending a lot of time working with frameworks and abstractions, this project was an opportunity to slow down and reinforce core skills:

- Use semantic elements correctly (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`, etc.)
- Think carefully about document structure and accessibility
- Rely on CSS fundamentals instead of utility libraries
- Improve naming conventions and code readability
- Build responsive layouts without shortcuts

This was a conscious exercise in **clarity over cleverness**.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- (Optional minimal JavaScript, if present)

No external libraries or frameworks were used:
- ❌ React
- ❌ Bootstrap
- ❌ Tailwind
- ❌ CSS frameworks of any kind

## Accessibility & Semantics

Accessibility was treated as a first-class concern:

- Semantic HTML used throughout
- Logical heading structure
- Accessible form markup
- Tested using accessibility tools such as **WAVE**
- Focus and hover states considered for keyboard navigation

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout adapts across:
- **Mobile**
- **Tablet**
- **Desktop**

Responsiveness is handled using:
- CSS variables
- Media queries
- Flexible layouts (Flexbox / Grid where appropriate)

## Design Notes

- Design closely follows the provided mockups
- CSS variables from the provided `style.css` are used as the foundation
- Hover states follow the provided design rules
- Transitions are kept subtle and intentional
- Some optional design elements were simplified where allowed by the assignment

## Assets & Resources

- Placeholder avatars from  
  https://avatar-placeholder.iran.liara.run/avatars
- Images from  
  https://picsum.photos/
- SVG assets provided with the assignment

All external resources are used purely for visual purposes.

## What I Practiced

- Writing HTML with intent
- Structuring CSS in a maintainable way
- Understanding layout behavior instead of trial-and-error
- Making design decisions within constraints
- Thinking about accessibility early, not as an afterthought

## Final Notes

This project is not about showing off advanced techniques — it’s about **strengthening fundamentals**.

Being comfortable with the basics makes every higher-level tool easier to understand, debug, and reason about later on.

If you have any questions about specific implementation details, I’m happy to explain the reasoning behind them.
